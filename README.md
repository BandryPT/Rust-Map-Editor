# Rust.World

This is a rough initial iteration of the Rust World SDK. In its current state it allows the creation of tools that load, visualize, edit and save the terrain object from the map file. Working with prefab and path data is not recommended in this initial version and will be added in the near future.

WARNING: Only use this extremely early version of the SDK if you enjoy pain and suffering.

## Getting Started

* As of Unity 2018.1 you need to manually switch your project to the [.NET 4.x runtime](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingRuntimeUpgrade.html) after creating it
* The `WorldExample` class demonstrates how to load and work with a map file

## Roadmap

* Support loading assets from asset bundles that ship with the game
* Demonstrate how to work with path data in the map file
